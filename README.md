Project 1: Website Data Classification

Utilized pandas and matplotlib to explore and visualize the dataset, identifying missing values and gaining insights into the distribution of numerical and categorical variables.

Analyzed the distribution of key metrics such as 'Numof Clicks,' 'Mins spent,' and 'Frequency' to understand user engagement with the website.

Investigated the distribution of devices used by visitors and their geographical locations, providing a comprehensive overview of user demographics.

Employed LabelEncoder from scikit-learn to preprocess categorical variables, enabling the utilization of machine learning algorithms on the dataset.

Implemented a Decision Tree Classifier to predict the 'Category' variable based on features like device, location, and timestamp, demonstrating the application of machine learning for classification tasks.

Split the dataset into training and testing sets, trained the Decision Tree Classifier, and evaluated the model's performance using classification reports and a confusion matrix.

Demonstrated the model's ability to predict user categories, providing valuable information for understanding and segmenting the user base of the website.
